"""The M9 reachable-state mass-balance certificate — the gate that replaced M5's ‖S·T‖ bar.

**Why this exists.** M5 gated on `RoundingDiagnostics.transform_mass_balance_error`, a per-direction
componentwise backward error. M9 measured it across RNG streams and found it rejects **8 of 24**
streams on a polytope that is perfectly samplable — the `model_id` *string* decided whether a
genome-scale model could be sampled, because the residual it divides is an inherited absolute floor
and some rows' cancellation scales are ~1e-5.

The replacement asks the operative question — *can the chain reach a state that violates mass
balance?* — and the load-bearing test is the first one: **the certificate must be able to refuse.**
A gate that certifies everything is not a gate, and this repository has twice shipped a test that
could not fail on the bug it existed to catch (M4's truncated basis, M6's `s_J` floor).
